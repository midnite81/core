## Installation

This package requires PHP 8.1+ and has a Laravel Service Provider, which is auto-registered.

To install through composer include the package in your composer.json.
```composer
"midnite81/core": "^2.0"
```

Run composer install or composer update to download the dependencies, or you can run;

```bash
composer require midnite81/core
```

### Service Providers

By default, `Midnite81\Core\CoreServiceProvider` is automatically registered by laravel, unless you've actively turned
off auto registration in your application. Midnite81\Core ships with an additional service provider to enable the 
[Commands](docs/Commands.md) which come with this package. To install this (or both if needed), you need to add them 
to your `config/app.php`

```php
'providers' => [
//  ...
    \Midnite81\Core\CoreServiceProvider::class, // this is auto installed
    \Midnite81\Core\CoreCommandServiceProvider::class
//  ...
]
```

### Configuration files

You may wish to publish the configuration file if you're planning on using the 
[FireScriptCommand](docs/Commands/FireScriptsCommand.md) or 
[QuickFireScriptCommand](docs/Commands/QuickFireScriptsCommand.md)

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Midnite81\Core\CoreServiceProvider"
```
