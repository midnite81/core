This is a package for core activity within laravel projects. This is a work in progress and as such documentation is 
sparse, however in the coming weeks and months (and hopefully not years!), I hope to update this documentation.

This package contains;

- [Artisan Commands](docs/Commands.md)
- Attributes
- Eloquent Helpers
- Entities, Responses and Requests
- Exceptions
- Helper Functions
  - first
  - uuid
- Helper Classes 
  - Arrays
  - Attempts
  - ClassRetriever
  - HtmlLinks
  - Matches
  - Strings
  - UserAgent
- Middleware
- Base Actions and Repositories
- Uuid Generator
